## Logistic Regression Algorithm

Logistic regression is a widely-used statistical method for binary classification tasks. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.

1. **Modeling Probability**: Logistic regression models the probability that an input data point belongs to a specific class using the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function). The sigmoid function transforms the output into a range between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class.

2. **Parameter Estimation**: Logistic regression estimates the parameters (coefficients) of the linear equation using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Newton-Raphson method. These parameters determine the slope and intercept of the decision boundary.

3. **Decision Boundary**: Logistic regression predicts the class of a new data point based on whether the estimated probability (output of the sigmoid function) is above or below a certain threshold (usually 0.5). If the probability is above the threshold, the data point is classified as belonging to the positive class; otherwise, it is classified as belonging to the negative class.

4. **Cost Function**: Logistic regression uses a cost function (such as the cross-entropy loss) to measure the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels. The goal is to minimize this cost function during training.


5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC curve.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters such as regularization strength and threshold through techniques like cross-validation or grid search.

Logistic regression is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and marketing, due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.
