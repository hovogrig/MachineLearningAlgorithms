## k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regressor is a simple yet effective algorithm used for regression tasks. It predicts the value of a new data point based on the average (or weighted average) of the target variable of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

1. **Initialization**: Choose the value of k, the number of nearest neighbors to consider.

2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between the new data point and every other data point in the dataset. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.

3. **Nearest Neighbors Selection**: Select the k nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.

4. **Average Prediction**: Calculate the average (or weighted average) of the target variable of the k nearest neighbors. Weighted averaging assigns more influence to closer neighbors.

5. **Prediction**: Assign the calculated average value as the predicted target value for the new data point.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the KNN regressor using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared (R2).

7. **Optimization**: Optimize the value of k and the choice of distance metric through techniques like cross-validation or grid search to improve the regressor's performance.
