## k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for classification tasks. It classifies a new data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

1. **Initialization**: Choose the value of k, the number of nearest neighbors to consider.

2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between the new data point and every other data point in the dataset. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity.

3. **Nearest Neighbors Selection**: Select the k nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.

4. **Majority Voting**: Determine the class of the new data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors. This can be achieved through simple majority voting or weighted voting, where closer neighbors have more influence.

5. **Prediction**: Assign the class label of the majority class to the new data point as its predicted class.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the KNN classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC curve.

7. **Optimization**: Optimize the value of k and the choice of distance metric through techniques like cross-validation or grid search to improve the classifier's performance.
