## Ridge Regression Algorithm

Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in regression models. It extends ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which helps to stabilize the model and reduce the impact of multicollinearity.

1. **Regularization**: Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the standard OLS cost function, known as the L2 regularization term. This term penalizes large coefficients by adding their squared values to the cost function. The regularization parameter (lambda or alpha) controls the strength of the penalty.

2. **Cost Function**: The cost function for ridge regression is the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable, plus the regularization term. The goal is to minimize this modified cost function during training.

3. **Parameter Estimation**: Ridge regression estimates the coefficients of the linear regression model by minimizing the modified cost function using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or closed-form solutions like the ridge regression equation.

4. **Shrinkage Effect**: The L2 regularization term encourages the coefficients of less important features to shrink towards zero, reducing their influence on the model's predictions. This helps to mitigate the problem of overfitting caused by multicollinearity and high dimensionality.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Selecting the appropriate value of the regularization parameter (lambda or alpha) is crucial for the performance of ridge regression. This hyperparameter can be optimized using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the ridge regression model using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared (R2).

Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with high collinearity or multicollinearity among the independent variables. It provides a stable and reliable method for regression analysis by controlling the influence of correlated features.
