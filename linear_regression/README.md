## Linear Regression Algorithm

Linear regression works by finding the best-fitting line through the data points, which represents the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This line is determined by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the parameters of the linear equation (slope and intercept).

2. **Prediction**: Use the current parameters to predict the values of the dependent variable based on the independent variable(s).

3. **Error Calculation**: Calculate the error between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

4. **Gradient Descent**: Adjust the parameters of the linear equation iteratively to minimize the error. This adjustment is done using gradient descent, where the gradient of the error with respect to each parameter is computed, and the parameters are updated in the direction that reduces the error.

5. **Convergence**: Repeat steps 2-4 until the algorithm converges, i.e., until the change in the parameters (slope and intercept) becomes very small or the error reaches a minimum.

6. **Final Model**: Once the algorithm converges, the final parameters represent the best-fitting line through the data points. This line can be used to make predictions on new data or to understand the relationship between the variables.
